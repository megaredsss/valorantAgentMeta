<h1 align="center">Valorant agent meta</h1>
---
If you play Valorant, you know that agent selection is a big part of your potential victory. Your choice depends on the card and role, but the stats sites have numbers that don't correlate with each other and seem to be random. To me the real stats are from professional games, the best site about them is https://www.vlr.gg/, but it has an unreadable table. This program allows you to simply enter the name of a map and get the 5 agents with the highest winrate on that map. The program generates data based on data from the site and from the last official tournament.
